Creating the flight ticket system in Python was an exciting project that allowed me to delve into the intricacies of software development. 
The system operates by providing users with a straightforward interface to book and manage their flight tickets.
Upon launching the program, users are greeted with a menu where they can select various options such as viewing available flights,
booking a ticket, and checking their booking status. To enhance the user experience, I incorporated error handling mechanisms, 
ensuring smooth interactions and minimizing potential issues during input. For the flight booking process, users can input details like their name,
destination, and preferred travel dates. The system then checks the availability of flights based on the provided information. 
If a suitable flight is found, the user is prompted to confirm the booking. To streamline the system further, 
I implemented features like ticket cancellation and viewing the booking history. 
The program uses file handling to store and retrieve booking information, ensuring data persistence between sessions.
Throughout the development, emphasis was placed on creating a user-friendly and efficient system. The Python code utilizes functions, 
loops, and conditional statements to manage the different aspects of flight bookings. Overall, 
this flight ticket system in Python stands as a practical and functional tool for users to manage their air travel plans with ease.
